# rock-paper-scissors

Rock Paper Scissors game for the Odin Project.
Game is played entirely in the console, no GUI.


GUI additions:
- R: three buttons
- R: display results
- P: enlarge button on hover
- P: image on button
- R: display running score
- R: display winner who got 5 points
- P: use table
- P: create 'arrows'
- P: change colors for win/loss >>
- P: add/remove classes for win/loss


ISSUES:
- if one of the RPS buttons is clicked in quick succession it can go past score 5 due to the delay function. This is a fixable issue that will not be addresses in this version.
- results display is cleared before it changes. it uses the delay function so also small issues. will not be addressed.
- the win/lose game notification is in alert window. it should pop a new window but much more elegant with option to stay in game or not. will not be addressed in this version.
